# Finance_Dash1
First dashboard using streamlit.

This project began as a small project to learn streamlit via deploying a finance dashboard. 

It has evolved into a more robust project where i am working to deploy not just a report of stock price values but also ratio analyses, comparatives to stock indices, and automated valuation modelling.

Using Streamlit allows for fast deployment to my website which was important when deciding how to develop the dashboard. 

I am using Yfinance for financial metrics, Alpha Vantage for detailed financial statements, and stocknews for headline and sentiment pulls.
